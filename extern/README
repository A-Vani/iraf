This README file replaces the one originally inluded with IRAF 2.16.  The
original README has been renamed to README.orig.

IRAF 2.16 makes available a number of external packages that the can be
installed by running "./configure", followed by "make package" for each desired
package.  However, all of the external packages provided in the NOAO repository
are included with Ureka, so this functionality has been removed.

These external packages are included with Ureka:

    adccdrom
    cfh12k
    ctio
    deitab
    esowfi
    fitsutil
    guiapps
    mem0
    mscdb
    mscred
    mtools
    nfextern
    optic
    rvsao
    song
    sqiid
    stecf
    stsdas
    tables
    ucsclris
    upsqiid
    xdimsum

There are some known bugs in the these packages.

[TODO: more about bugs]
